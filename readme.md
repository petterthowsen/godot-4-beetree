Simple Behavior Tree Addon for Godot 4 beta

Not much to explain - contains nodes such as sequence, selector etc.

Also an IfNode to check the result of a call to the agent property (or method) on the tree.

Usage:
Add a BeeTree node, and add child nodes. For custom nodes, extend the BeeTreeNode class.
